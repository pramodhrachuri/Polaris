            The hostel lifestyle is an integral part of the one’s college life. Here, at IIT Bhilai, the hostel life is much more than
            just ‘hanging out’. Our student community is very enthusiatic which is why being here is a totally vivid experience.
            Even though in its infancy, IIT Bhilai has developed a rich student cluture where students from different communities
            come together and have time of their lifetime. As part of student activities we have established the official
            student body, Council of Student Affairs(CoSA). Under it function various clubs and associations, each having
            a coordinator. Students are encouraged to actively participate in the clubs whoch interests them. This makes
            hostel life exciting and fun.

          <p class="light" style="text-align: justify;">
            IIT Bhilai is located in its temporary campus which is inside the premises of The Government Engineering College(GEC), Raipur.
            One striking feature of the campus is that it houses not two but three leading Institutions, the third one being
            IIM Raipur.

            <p class="light" style="text-align: justify;">
              The campus is about 12 km from Raipur Junction Railway Station, 16 km from Raipur Airport and 13 km from Pandri Bus Stand,
              Raipur. Auto Rickshaws are easily available from these places to the campus.

          <p class="light" style="text-align: justify;">
            There are separate hostels for boys and girls which are also in the premises of GEC, Raipur. When it started in 2016, The
            boys hostel had a capacity of 120 students and 40 in the girl’s hostel, but the numbers are being increased for
            the upcoming batches.

          <h4 class="header cyan-text text-accent-4 center">Types of Rooms</h4>
          <p class="light" style="text-align: justify;">
            There are two types of rooms in the boys’ hostel:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>4 people per room</li>
            <li>2 people per room</li>

          </ul>
          <p class="light" style="text-align: justify;">
            In the girls’ hostel you will find just one kind of rooms i.e. the rooms meant for 4 people.

          <p class="light" style="text-align: justify;">
            Being an IIT it is needless to say that we have an excellent internet connectivity. The
            <strong>NKN (National Knowledge Network)</strong> program is the Internet service provider for the institute and supports
            network speeds of up to 1 GB/s. Although in the elementary stage, the NKN network is useful as it provides connectivity
            to other institutes, has resources like video lectures, seminars etc.
            <br> Each student has access to the network through the LAN ports provided in the hostel rooms as well as Wi-Fi (each
            student is allotted a unique ID-Password for accessing).
            <br> We also have a DC++ culture in the hostel (Google it and you will learn that DC++ is the life line of IIT hostels).
            It is a really productive file sharing system with a host server and various other clients linked to it. It comes
            in handy to share large files, academic softwares and recreational stuff (like movies, games, TV series).
            <br> Students are encouraged to avail the benefits of the system in the hostel. Apart from the above, all students
            have access to a common file storage system. Students can use it as a drive to drop/retrieve/share files with
            peers.

                    from the Orators club. Initially confined to the arena of public-speaking, it was decided that the club
                    would expand its ventures and dabble in other literary fields too. The society is a vibrant one, with
                    lots of regular and interesting activities, that both serve to be fun as well as beneficial. Every student
                    taking part in these activities is encouraged to come out of his/her shell and start communicating effectively.
                    <br> The society also has its own newsletter, called the Couch Potato. The contents are typically informal
                    and talk about the most interesting things happening in and around the campus. In all, it is a society
                    that's definitely worth joining, if you want a major upgrade to your people skills!</p>

                    talent, skills & have achieved excellence in the field of academics. The Epsilon Club, a club under the
                    Science & Technology Clubs, IIT Bhilai, is a prodigious & one of the most appreciated feature of this
                    Institute. The idea of providing a common platform for students interested in either Robotics, or Basic
                    Sciences, or both, is what makes it different from other clubs. The main motive of the club is to provide
                    a really strong platform for bringing his/her ideas on Robotics or Basic Sciences, into reality. The
                    Club provides all the necessary assistance for the same. Alongwith, there are several other club activities
                    discussed below. With the motto of “IMAGINE, INVENT, INSPIRE” the club came into establishment in April
                    2017. Our esteemed group shares a common passion for the field of Robotics & for the field of Basic Sciences.

                    <strong>About</strong>: The newest society of IIT Bhilai, SES is an astronomical society that seeks to provide
                    a platform for conducting activities in the fields of observational astronomy, theoretical astrophysics,
                    and aerospace engineering. As a new society, we have not had any activities conducted yet, but we have
                    prepared an introductory newsletter as a part of the launch. The initial activities are planned to be
                    in the form of presentations. Once we purchase telescopes, the observational activities can begin, which
                    will be very fun! The aerospace part is still under planning, and will probably start functioning a while
                    later as compared to the other 2 segments.

            Education – for many this is probably one of the most important factors of our lives and from a very young age children work
            their way through the education system before being able to make their own decisions about whether to continue
            their learning through college, university and further education. As part of our educational syllabus we are
            expected to learn about a number of subjects, however, one of particular interest to us is physical education
            and sports, as they have a massive part to play within the education system.
            <br> Sports teach us key values such as: Teamwork, Respect, Passion, Hard work and many other key attributes that
            help towards developing an individual’s character.
            <br> Presence of good sports facilities is a vital tool in developing the above skills. The following sections elaborate
            on the sports facilities present at IIT Bhilai which will help the students to tackle the challenging curriculum
            with renewed vigour.
            <br> For indoor games there is a recreation room in both the hostels. It houses T.T., board games, pool and Television
            facilities.

            The hostel has first-aid facilities along with medications for common ailments. If one needs to see a doctor, he can find
            him at the academic block in the Nurse room. A paramedic is always available at the campus and so is the ambulance
            service (An ambulance vehicle available 24 x 7 in the campus). In case of emergency or any other medical call,
            one is taken to the nearest Hospital: The VY Hospital (Located about 5 km from the campus, distance is covered
            within 15 min due to presence of wide and less busy roads). It is functional 24 x 7 and has all major facilities.

          <p class="light" style="text-align: justify;">
            The boys hostel is located at a distance of about 900m from the academic block. A wide road within the campus connects both.
            There are plenty of options to ply between these two:

          <ul style="text-align: justify;">
            <li>&cir;&nbsp; You can walk without even breaking a sweat (Can’t guarantee about summers though)</li>
            <li>&cir;&nbsp; Paddle your way to the Acad. Block</li>
            <li> &cir;&nbsp;Lazy enough? Well there is a bus service back and forth from the hostel to the Acad. Block. It runs
              at scheduled times- generally half and prior to lectures and lunch.

            </li>
            <li> &cir;&nbsp;Girls Hostel is just behind the Academic Block, roughly half as far as the boys hostel.</li>
