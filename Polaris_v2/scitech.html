But often in such a competitive environment, work is stressed to the point of mania and this is when comes in the need of recreation. Rediscover your hobbies and explore new ones with Clubs at IIT Bhilai. Mind you there is absolutely no bound on anyone’s interest which also means that there is no bound on how many clubs you can be in – it is all up to you. Currently the following clubs are functional and conduct their respective activities at a regular basis:</p>

As a new society, we have not had any activities conducted yet, but we have prepared an introductory newsletter as a part of the launch. The initial activities are planned to be in the form of presentations. Once we purchase telescopes, the observational activities can begin, which will be very fun! The aerospace part is still under planning, and will probably start functioning a while later as compared to the other 2 segments. </p>
