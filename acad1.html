          <p style="text-align: justify;" class="light">The academic system of IIT Bhilai has been derived from the system of our mentor institute, IIT Hyderabad. The
            system, called the Fractal System, involves distributing courses across semesters. The curriculum gives due importance
            to developing crucial practical skills required in industry, in addition to the required theoretical knowledge.
            Nearly all the classes are now being conducted by professors hired within the institute, with a few professors
            from IITH being present as well.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;" class="light">Before we dive right into the departmental subjects offered lets first talk about the common subjects that are
            taught to all the streams. Since you will be studying in the Fractal system, a drastically different system compared
            to the existing systems in place at the other IIT’s which follow mostly the traditional system; you will be introduced
            to the core subjects from the very first semester. The common subjects that we study are slightly different from
            what is taught elsewhere and is slightly more industry inclined. With that we begin the list of subjects.</p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">IIT Bhilai has adopted a very innovative academic structure (courtesy IIT Hyderabad), referred to as Fractal
                    Academics which is the first step in creating an experiential learning ambience.</p>
                  <div class="container">
                    <ul>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;At the centre of Fractal Academics is the concept of
                        <strong>T-education</strong> -- Breadth and Depth.</li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;Under ‘T’ education, we have classified the courses that require width and length for training
                        separately. </li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;Subsequently, each subject is fractalised (divided) into various segments with 1 or 2 credits.</li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;Breadth courses are basic building block for the depth courses. </li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;The fundamental idea is to atomize the credits to enable the students to get breadth in
                        a large number of courses and depth in the courses of your choice.</li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;Initial emphasis is on breadth courses (first four semesters) and then on depth.</li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;Breadth courses are typically of 1 credit. There are plenty of such courses to help build
                        a broad perspective. Introductory core courses provide students a window into further important topics.</li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;Depth courses are built on the foundation set by the breadth courses and are of 2 credits
                        or more. For e.g., courses in the first semester are intended to provide a glimpse of all the core
                        areas in EE viz., control systems, communication and signal processing, microelectronics and power
                        electronics.</li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;In-depth coverage of core topics is offered in the depth courses. </li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;Often students build products/prototypes – bridging gulf between theory and practice.</li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;A balance is sought between technical and non-technical courses to reduce stress in students.</li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;There are numerous liberal arts/creative arts courses too depending upon student’s choice.
                        (These include 1 credit courses related to Economics, Arts, Performing Arts, Management etc.)</li>

                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;There are departmental core courses in the very first semester and this creates an excitement
                        to pursue research, develop new technologies and possibly be entrepreneurs.</li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;The breadth courses help students make an informed decision on their specialization choices.</li>

                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp; Students get exposure to basic tools early. Here: MatLab, SolidEdge, GNU Octave, Arduino

                    <ul>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;The design of the system itself reduces the course burden, hence giving you ample amount
                        of time to explore the topic.</li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;Observe what intrigues you, which topic catches your fancy and start working on it. In a
                        straight forward fashion: Discover your passion.</li>
                      <br/>
                      <li style="text-align: justify;">&cir;&nbsp;Many courses will be hands on (significant duration of course will be in labs or on computers),
                        hence there will be ample opportunities to pick up practical skills which actually matter in the

                    <strong>About the Department:</strong> The first thing which pops up when you think of CSE is programming. Given
                    that coding is an integral part of Computer Science, it is not the only part. As the name suggests, one
                    learns both the science behind the computers and the engineering aspects of the field. CSE at IIT Bhilai
                    is focussed on providing the students with a perfect blend of both – research and industrial facet of
                    the computing world.</p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <strong>Courses during the first year:</strong> The courses for computer science students during the first year
                    can be classified as follows:</p>

                      <strong>a. Theory Courses:</strong> For the first year students, Discrete Mathematics is the only theory course
                      provided. The course is spread over two semesters with a weightage of 2 credits in each sem. It deals
                      with the mathematical aspects of the computers. The part in the first semester will cover the following:</p>
                    <div class="container">
                      <p style="text-align: justify;">i. Boolean Algebra/ Logical Statements
                        <br/> ii. How to write proofs for various logical statements
                        <br/> iii. Modular Algebra
                        <br/> iv. Application of the above concepts in game theory, cryptography etc. at a very basic level.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                      <strong>b. Theory + Lab Courses:</strong> Introduction to Programming is the course taught during the first
                      semester. The language to work with will be C. The course is taught from scratch and requires no prior
                      knowledge of coding. However, one needs to back the theory taught in class with sufficient coding for
                      the concepts to stick in your mind. Four or Five practical assignments with gradually increasing difficulty
                      level will be given at regular intervals and the evaluation of the same will form a part of final grading.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The second semester will introduce you to the world of “Algorithms and Data Structures”. They are the
                      building blocks of every software application you have ever fiddled with. Implementing the algorithms
                      and data structures through a programming language is a skill which every computer science enthusiast
                      should hone. The course is taught in C language and build up on the programming knowledge which you
                      have developed in the first semester. At the end of the semester you get a chance to apply your skills
                      in coding a project.</p>

                      Engineering. You have studied mechanics before, well this takes it beyond Newton’s laws of motion and
                      introduces more powerful ways to analyse dynamical systems namely the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation
                      of Classical mechanics</p>

                      take up advanced computing. The course primarily deals with matrices, builds up on the matrices you
                      studied for JEE and takes you on a ride (pun intended :P) towards exploring advanced concepts such
                      as eigen values and eigen vectors. </p>

                              of pointers), mainly C language would surely help you to catch pace during the various courses.

                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              3) Get some knowledge about Linux based systems, mainly Ubuntu. There are plenty of resources on the net to help you install
                              the same along with your Windows OS.

                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              4) Having some knowledge of Python and MATLAB can be helpful in some courses as these languages are used as tools in their
                              assignments (Digital Signal Processing).

                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              5) Advanced C concepts such as Algorithms and Data Structures can be studied. This will help you breeze through the basics
                              in the classes and focus on more advanced concepts.

                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              6) Try reading about analysis of algorithms, mainly in terms of time complexity.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              7) Some basic familiarity with Discrete Mathematics/Mathematical Logic will really help you in some of the courses but is
                              not compulsory.

                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              8) The world is at your feet in form of the internet. Explore the same for your benefit.

                    <strong>Expectations from the Department</strong>: The EE department at IIT Bhilai even though being relatively
                    new, thrives to provide students a deep insight into the core concepts of the subject. It encompasses
                    the areas of traditional teaching methods and latest developing technology. Many Universities and colleges
                    have separate courses under Electronics and Communication (ECE), Electrical and Electronics (EEE), and
                    Electrical Engineering (EE) each having a specialization in the respective field. However, our approach
                    is to bring to all of this under one common roof so that students are able to master themselves in the
                    subject of their desire. </p>

                            "Dude enjoy it (first year)! You will not get time later on." This is what you will hear coming to IIT most of the time from
                            seniors. DON’T get FOOLED by them. First year is the foundation of coming years. So study and
                            enjoy I a balanced manner.

                          </p>
                          <div class="container">
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              1. Do small projects on weekend. Learn the use of sensors. This will help you in IOT class and Independent projects.

                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              2. Coding: Make yourself comfortable with programming in first year only. Without learning programming you may fall back
                              in many areas of EE in the future.

                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              3. Solve many problems in core subjects like Analog electronics, Semiconductors, Signals and Systems etc.

                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              4.Technical Skills:
                              <br> (a.) Learn to use electrical instruments like Oscilloscope, Function generator, Digital Multimeter
                              in EE lab.
                              <br> (b.) Develop the skills of doing circuit analysis using Laplace transform, differential equations
                              etc. Most of the time you have to do this.

                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              5.Online Course: Follow the websites like Udacity, Coursera for online courses (on long holidays).

                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              6.Soft Skills:
                              <br> (a.) MATLAB (Used for Data Analytics)
                              <br> (b.) Python (Considering the first year this is more important for DSP and Data Analytics)
                              <br> (c.) C language (for Data Structure and Arduino programming)

                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              7. Maths: It is a natural tendency of most students after coming to IIT to neglect maths. DON’T do it! In CSE we can see
                              the result of our programmings on screen. And in Mechanical Engineering whatever is happening
                              we can see it physically e.g. by applying force, weighing it etc. But in EE we can’t. First
                              we need to MODEL IT in MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS and then see, what is the output for particular
                              input.
                              <br>So topics in maths like Vector Calculus, Fourier and Laplace transforms, Differential Equations,
                              Matrix Analysis are very important. Don’t detest these subjects.

                    studying in this department one can also work in other domains of engineering such as Design, Manufacturing,
                    Aeronautical and Thermal Engineering for research as well as practical applications. There are some really
                    great opportunities for research in Manufacturing field due to need of mass production with less environmental
                    side effects.</p>

                              1. Mechanical Engineering is all about understanding existing systems and then designing new ones inspired by the ones we
                              have studied. It will be beneficial if you have your JEE concepts fresh for the following topics:
                              <br>a. Fluid Mechanics
                              <br>b. General Mechanics
